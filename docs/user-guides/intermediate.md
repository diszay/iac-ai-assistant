# Intermediate Guide to Proxmox AI Infrastructure Assistant

Welcome to intermediate-level infrastructure automation! This guide assumes you're comfortable with basic VM creation and are ready to tackle multi-VM deployments, automation workflows, and production-ready configurations.

## üéØ What You'll Master

- **Multi-VM Architectures**: Load balancers, web servers, and databases working together
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Using Ansible for configuration management
- **Production Patterns**: High availability, scaling, and monitoring
- **Advanced AI Features**: Context-aware optimizations and complex scenario handling

## üèóÔ∏è Multi-VM Infrastructure Patterns

### Web Application Stack

Let's create a complete web application infrastructure with separate components:

```bash
# Generate a full web application stack
proxmox-ai generate terraform --skill-level intermediate \
  --description "NGINX load balancer with 2 web servers and PostgreSQL database"
```

This will create a configuration that includes:
- **Load Balancer**: NGINX proxy distributing traffic
- **Web Servers**: Multiple application servers for redundancy
- **Database**: PostgreSQL server with proper networking
- **Networking**: Internal networks for security
