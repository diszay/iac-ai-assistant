## üìã Development Workflow & Security Guidelines

### **Development Process Protocol:**

#### **1. Initial Analysis and Planning**
- **Objective**: First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to `tasks/todo.md`
- **Security Focus**: Every plan must include security impact assessment and threat modeling
- **Approach**: Analyze current state, identify gaps, and create actionable tasks with security checkpoints

#### **2. Todo List Structure**
- **Format**: The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
- **Security Requirements**: Each task must include security validation criteria
- **Priority**: Tasks ranked by business impact, technical dependencies, and security criticality

#### **3. Plan Verification**
- **Process**: Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan
- **Security Review**: All plans require security architecture review before implementation
- **Approval**: No development work begins without explicit plan approval and security sign-off

#### **4. Task Execution**
- **Methodology**: Begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go
- **Security Testing**: Each task completion requires security validation and testing
- **Focus**: Work on one task at a time to maintain quality and security posture

#### **5. Communication**
- **Frequency**: Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
- **Security Updates**: Include security implications and any new attack surface considerations
- **Clarity**: Focus on business impact, user-facing changes, and security improvements

#### **6. Simplicity Principle**
- **Philosophy**: Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible
- **Security by Design**: Simple code is more secure code - avoid complex security mechanisms
- **Impact**: Every change should impact as little code as possible while maintaining security boundaries

#### **7. Process Documentation**
- **Activity Logging**: Every time you perform actions related to the project, write a log of your actions to `docs/activity.md`
- **Security Logging**: Document all security-related decisions and their rationale
- **Reference**: Read that file whenever you find it necessary to assist you

#### **8. Review Process**
- **Completion**: Finally, add a review section to the `todo.md` file with a summary of the changes you made
- **Security Assessment**: Include security impact analysis and any residual risks
- **Documentation**: Update relevant security documentation with new features or changes

### **Comprehensive Security Requirements:**

#### **Code Security Standards:**
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All credentials, API keys, and sensitive data must be externalized
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs and Proxmox API parameters
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions for all operations and service accounts
- **Secure Communication**: All network communications must use TLS 1.3 or SSH encryption
- **Error Handling**: Never expose sensitive information in error messages or logs

#### **Infrastructure Security:**
- **VM Isolation**: Each VM must be properly isolated with dedicated firewall rules
- **Network Segmentation**: Use VLANs and network policies to isolate different environments
- **Encrypted Storage**: All VM disks must use LUKS encryption with strong passphrases
- **SSH Key Management**: Implement automated key rotation and secure key distribution
- **Backup Security**: All backups must be encrypted and stored with access controls

#### **Operational Security:**
- **Audit Logging**: Log all infrastructure changes, access attempts, and administrative actions
- **Monitoring**: Implement real-time monitoring for security events and anomalies
- **Incident Response**: Maintain documented incident response procedures and contact lists
- **Compliance**: Ensure all operations meet relevant security frameworks (CIS, NIST)
- **Regular Security Assessments**: Schedule periodic security reviews and penetration testing

#### **Development Security:**
- **Secure Development**: Follow secure coding practices and regular security code reviews
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security scanning of all dependencies and libraries
