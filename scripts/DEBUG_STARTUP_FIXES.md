# Startup Script Debug Report & Fixes

## Root Cause Analysis

The startup script was auto-closing due to several critical issues:

### 1. **Primary Issue: `set -e` Command**
- **Problem**: Script used `set -e` causing immediate exit on ANY error
- **Impact**: Any failed command (even non-critical ones) would terminate the script
- **Fix**: Removed `set -e` and implemented explicit error handling

### 2. **Model Download Issues**
- **Problem**: `ollama pull` could fail or be interrupted with no recovery
- **Impact**: Long downloads would fail and close terminal immediately
- **Fix**: Added robust download with retry logic, progress indication, and graceful failure handling

### 3. **GUI vs Terminal Execution**
- **Problem**: No differentiation between GUI file manager and terminal execution
- **Impact**: GUI-launched scripts would close immediately on errors
- **Fix**: Added GUI mode detection and pause functionality

### 4. **Poor Error Handling**
- **Problem**: Limited debugging output and no graceful degradation
- **Impact**: Users couldn't see what went wrong before window closed
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive error messages and debug information

## Key Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Error Handling Framework**
```bash
# Removed dangerous 'set -e'
# Added cleanup trap
cleanup() {
    local exit_code=$?
    if [[ $exit_code -ne 0 ]]; then
        print_error "Script encountered an error (exit code: $exit_code)"
        print_info "Press Enter to close this window or Ctrl+C to abort..."
        read -r
    fi
}
trap cleanup EXIT
```

### 2. **GUI Mode Detection**
```bash
# Detect if running from GUI file manager
if [[ -z "$TERM" ]] || [[ "$TERM" == "dumb" ]]; then
    GUI_MODE=true
    echo "Detected GUI execution mode - terminal will stay open for debugging"
else
    GUI_MODE=false
fi
```

### 3. **Robust Model Download**
```bash
download_model_robust() {
    local model="$1"
    local max_attempts=3
    local attempt=1
    
    while [[ $attempt -le $max_attempts ]]; do
        # Download with timeout and retry logic
        if timeout 1800 ollama pull "$model" 2>&1 | tee "$log_file"; then
            return 0
        else
            # Handle partial downloads and retries
        fi
    done
}
```

### 4. **Improved Service Startup**
```bash
# Wait up to 15 seconds for Ollama service to start
for i in {1..15}; do
    if check_port 11434; then
        print_status "Ollama service started successfully"
        break
    fi
    print_info "Waiting for Ollama service... ($i/15)"
    sleep 1
done
```

## Testing Results

### ✅ Fixed Issues:
1. **Auto-close behavior**: Script now stays open in GUI mode
2. **Model downloads**: Robust retry logic with progress indication
3. **Error visibility**: Clear error messages with debug information
4. **Graceful degradation**: Script continues even if optional components fail

### ✅ Execution Methods Tested:
1. **Terminal execution**: Works with proper error handling
2. **GUI file manager**: Detects GUI mode and keeps window open
3. **Command line arguments**: Properly handles all startup modes

### ✅ Error Scenarios Handled:
1. **Python version issues**: Clear guidance on installation
2. **Virtual environment problems**: Detailed error messages
3. **Dependency installation failures**: Specific error reporting
4. **Ollama service startup failures**: Multiple retry attempts
5. **Model download interruptions**: Resume capability and retries

## Usage Instructions

### From Terminal:
```bash
./scripts/start-assistant.sh              # Setup and show options
./scripts/start-assistant.sh chat         # Start chat mode
./scripts/start-assistant.sh config       # Setup configuration
./scripts/start-assistant.sh status       # Check system status
```

### From GUI File Manager:
1. Right-click the script → "Open with Terminal" or "Run in Terminal"
2. Script will detect GUI mode and keep window open
3. Follow on-screen instructions

### Debug Mode:
- Script now provides detailed error messages
- Shows current directory, Python version, and system info
- Logs download attempts and failures
- Provides specific guidance for each type of failure

## Security Notes

- All user input is properly quoted to prevent command injection
- Temporary files are cleaned up properly
- Download integrity is verified through Ollama's built-in checks
- No sensitive information is logged or displayed

## Future Improvements

1. **Progress bars**: Could add visual progress bars for downloads
2. **Background downloads**: Option to run downloads in background
3. **Pre-flight checks**: More comprehensive system compatibility checks
4. **Auto-recovery**: Automatic restart of failed services
