# Codebase Cleanup and Documentation Clarity - TODO Plan

## Objective
Analyze and clean up the codebase following CLAUDE.md methodology, ensuring only necessary files remain while fixing documentation confusion and maintaining application functionality.

## Security Focus
- Ensure no security-critical files are removed
- Maintain audit trail of all changes
- Verify no credentials or sensitive data in removed files
- Preserve security configuration structures

## Analysis Results

### Files/Directories with Code References (KEEP)
- ✅ `config/environments/` - **KEEP**: Referenced by `config_manager.py:163` for environment-specific configs
- ✅ `config/gitops/` - **KEEP**: Referenced by workflow orchestrator
- ✅ `config/templates/` - **KEEP**: Contains Terraform templates needed for infrastructure generation
- ✅ `src/` directory - **KEEP**: Core application code
- ✅ `tests/` directory - **KEEP**: Test suites for quality assurance

### Empty Directories with No Code References (ANALYZE FOR REMOVAL)
- ❓ `docs/templates/` - No code references found
- ❓ `docs/compliance/` - No code references found  
- ❓ `docs/security/procedures/` - No code references found
- ❓ `docs/security/policies/` - No code references found
- ❓ `docs/security/compliance/` - No code references found

### Documentation Files (REVIEW FOR CLARITY)
- ❓ `docs/AGENT_DEVELOPMENT_CONCEPT.md` vs `docs/DEVELOPMENT_AGENTS.md` - Potential confusion
- ❓ `GETTING_STARTED.md` vs `docs/QUICK_START.md` - Duplicate quick start guides
- ❓ Multiple README files in different locations

## TODO Tasks

### Phase 1: Documentation Clarity (Priority: HIGH)
- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Review and consolidate duplicate documentation
  - Compare `GETTING_STARTED.md` vs `docs/QUICK_START.md`
  - Merge or clearly differentiate their purposes
  - Security: No security implications
  
- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Clarify agent documentation confusion
  - Review `docs/AGENT_DEVELOPMENT_CONCEPT.md` vs `docs/DEVELOPMENT_AGENTS.md`
  - Ensure clear distinction and no conflicting information
  - Security: Verify no security procedures are contradicted

- [ ] **Task 1.3**: Simplify main README.md
  - Remove confusing sections
  - Point clearly to appropriate getting started guide
  - Security: Maintain security setup instructions

### Phase 2: Remove Unnecessary Empty Directories (Priority: MEDIUM)
- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Remove `docs/templates/` (if no future plans)
  - Verify no code references
  - Check if part of 5-agent development structure
  - Security: No security impact expected

- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Remove `docs/compliance/`, `docs/security/procedures/`, `docs/security/policies/`, `docs/security/compliance/`
  - Verify these are truly empty and unused
  - Check if they're placeholders for future security documentation
  - Security: HIGH - Ensure this doesn't remove planned security documentation structure

### Phase 3: Analyze Project Files (Priority: MEDIUM)
- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Review scripts in `scripts/` directory
  - `init_secrets.py` - Check if used by startup process
  - `setup_gitops.py` - Check if needed for GitOps functionality
  - Security: HIGH - These handle credentials and security setup

- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Review development vs runtime files
  - `docs/project-management/` - Development artifacts vs runtime needs
  - Multiple test report files - Keep only essential ones
  - Security: Ensure security test reports are preserved

### Phase 4: Create Environment Config Structure (Priority: LOW)
- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Create default environment configs
  - Since code expects `config/environments/`, create minimal structure
  - Add `.gitkeep` files or minimal config.yaml files
  - Security: Ensure no sensitive defaults

## Criteria for File Removal
1. ✅ **No Code References**: File/directory not referenced in source code
2. ✅ **Not Part of Core Functionality**: Not needed for application to run
3. ✅ **Not Required by 5-Agent Development**: Not part of development methodology
4. ✅ **No Security Impact**: Removal doesn't compromise security
5. ✅ **No Future Plans**: Not placeholder for planned features

## Security Validation
- All removed files will be checked for credentials
- Security-related empty directories require additional approval
- Maintain security testing and documentation structure
- Preserve audit trail in git history

## Communication Plan
- High-level explanation after each phase completion
- Security implications documented for each change
- Business impact: Simplified, cleaner codebase for users
- User-facing changes: Clearer documentation, easier onboarding

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Documentation confusion eliminated
- ✅ Only essential files remain
- ✅ Application still runs correctly
- ✅ Security posture maintained
- ✅ Clear user onboarding path
